# Learning Answer Set Programming from Examples

This is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook 
(deployed using [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#what-is-a-binder))
that collects exercises to learn Answer Set Programming from examples.

It is part of the course _Answer Set Solving in Practice_ of the University of Potsdam.

To run the notebook, click here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/potassco-asp-course/notebooks.git/master)
.

Once the notebook is running, 
the instructions of the exercises can be found in the file ``Instructions.ipynb``.

The exercises in ``Part-1`` are about programs without variables, and
the exercises in ``Part-2`` are about programs with variables.
Right now ``Part-2`` is empty, but it will be complete soon.
