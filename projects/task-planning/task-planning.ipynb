    "# Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to write an ASP encoding that solves a task-planning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of tasks, a set of workers, and a collection of constraints over the possible plans,\n",
    "the problem is to determine the starting day of each task and \n",
    "an assignment of workers to tasks such that all constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan begins on day 1, and ends on a final day specified in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task has an identifier, a length >= 1, and a deadline. \n",
    "It must be assigned a starting day such that \n",
    "the task finishes within the planning horizon \n",
    "and no later than its deadline.\n",
    "We say that a task of length 1 finishes on its starting day, \n",
    "a task of length 2 finishes on the day after its starting day, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some pairs of tasks may be ordered: in such cases, the first task must finish before the second task starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks may use resources, \n",
    "and each resource has a limit on the number of tasks that can use it simultaneously on any day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each worker has one or more categories.\n",
    "Each task may require an exact number of workers assigned to it, \n",
    "and may also impose a minimum requirement on the number of assigned workers of certain categories.\n",
    "If a worker belongs to many categories, they count for all of those categories, not just for one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workers cannot be assigned to tasks that overlap on any day, \n",
    "and they may have holidays on which they must not work.\n",
