    "# Problem Description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to write an ASP encoding for\n",
    "planning the movements of a group of robots that have to complete a set of jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots navigate an undirected graph over a sequence of time steps that range from 0 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each robot belongs to one class and starts at some specific node in the graph.\n",
    "At every time step, robots can either stay at their current node, \n",
    "or move to some adjacent node,\n",
    "but two robots cannot occupy the same node simultaneously\n",
    "(for example, robots r1 and r2 cannot be at node 1 at step 1)\n",
    "or swap their positions\n",
    "(for example, \n",
    "if at time point 0 robot r1 is at node 1 and robot r2 is at node 2, \n",
    "then at time point 1 it cannot be the case that r1 is at node 2 and r2 at node 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each job belongs to one class, has some deadline, \n",
    "and consists of a sequence of operations that must be executed in order.\n",
    "Each operation takes place at a designated node.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem consists of two parts:\n",
    "* a sequence of valid movements for each robot, and\n",
    "* an assignment of each job of a given class to exactly one robot of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot completes a job if it visits the places of the operations of the job in the right order, and it visits the place of the last operation before or at the deadline of the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution can assign more than one job to the same robot. \n",
    "In that case, the robot must execute the assigned jobs in some chosen order, \n",
    "one after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each operation takes one time step. \n",
    "This implies that if a job has two consecutive operations at the same node, \n",
    "then the robot assigned to that job must be at least two steps (not necessarily consecutive) \n",
    "at that node.\n",
    "The same happens if a robot completes a job at a given place, \n",
    "and its next job starts at the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution is optimal if it minimizes the overall number of robot movements.\n",
    "We count one movement each time a robot moves to an adjacent cell, and\n",
    "we count nothing when a robot remains at the same node."

    "Q: If a robot r1 is assigned two jobs j1 and j2, and the deadline of j1 is before the deadline of j2, must r1 complete j1 before completing j2? \n",

    "A: Not necessarily, it can first complete j2, and then complete j1, as long as they both meet their deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Suppose a robot r1 is assigned two jobs j1 and j2, and this robot chooses to complete j1 before j2. If, while completing j1, the robot moves to the node of the first operation of j2, must r1 come back to this node after completing j1?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Yes. The robots must execute their jobs separately, one after the other. In other words, the nodes that a robot has visited while completing one job are irrelevant for the completion of the other jobs."
