    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to write an ASP encoding that solves\n",
    "the problem of learning propositional formulas that classify some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *input* to the problem consists a set of examples, where each example has an identifier,\n",
    "is labeled as either positive or negative, and is associated with a set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input also includes a parameter *size* that fixes the size of the propositional formula to be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "the following table shows 6 examples over 26 attributes (from 'a' to 'z'):\n",
    "* example 1 is positive and has attributes c, d, h, i, m, n, and v;\n",

    "* If $F$ and $G$ are propositional formulas, then $(F \\wedge G)$ and $(F \\vee G)$ are propositional formulas.\n",

    "* If $F$ has the form $(G \\wedge H)$ or $(G \\vee H)$ then its size is $1$ plus the size of $G$ plus the size of $H$.\n",
